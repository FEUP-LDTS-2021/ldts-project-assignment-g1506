## LDTS_1506 - <SPACE RACE>

In a race against your opponent you have to reach the top to score one point. Along the way you can´t collide with the obstacles.
If you score more points that your opponent, before the time runs out you win!
This project was developed by Hugo Castro (up202006770@fe.up.pt) and Luís Paiva (up202006094@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2021/2022.
